Relationship to organization: Teacher
Overview:  Camille’s Academy, a private school with four branches located at Crane, Diamond, Lusignan and Soesdyke respectively. Established in 2000 by CEO Camille Deokie-Gorakh, being the first private school to be established on the East Bank of Demerara and eventually expanded as the years went by. The institution has been the winner of many prestigious awards one being the “Best Service based company with over 10 employees” by the US-based Business Excellence(BizX) Forum and awards for 2021. Camille’s Academy has been known for consistently producing 80 percent rate at the Caribbean Secondary Examination Certificate (CSEC) examination making them the best performing private school within the Region Four district. 
Problem: The school’s canteen at Camille’s Academy does not have a proper management and inventory system for the items they sell. This often leads to a lot of food wastage. It also becomes a hassle when having to manually count and make a “list” of items bought and sold. There is also no accurate way to gauge items the canteen would need to restock.  
 Aim: The aim is to create a computerized canteen management system that:
•        Manage food wastage- during inventory and planning, the foods/snacks can be reviewed and items that students dislike can be removed and replaced in the system by items that students will love or enjoy trying. 
•        Keeps an inventory for the canteen- all items being bought can be kept in a computerized system so therefore you can keep track of items you are low on and you will be notified when to stock up on the said item or when there’s excess to take the necessary action(s).
